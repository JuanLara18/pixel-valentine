## The idea

Instead of sending a card, you send a game.

Your special someone receives a link. They enter their name, play through 3 themed levels as a tiny Cupid, collecting hearts along the way. When they win — your personalized love letter appears on screen, typewriter effect and all, with exactly two buttons: **"Yes!"** and **"Obviously yes!"**

No install. No app. Just a URL and a lot of heart.

---

## Make it yours — edit ONE file

**`src/config/valentine.config.ts`** is the only file you need to touch:

```typescript
export const valentineConfig = {
  senderName: 'Your Name',                    // shown in the final love letter
  nickname: 'Honey',                          // their nickname
  nicknameQuestion: 'Can I call you {nickname}?',
  finalMessage: 'Will you be my Valentine?',
  dateDetails: 'February 14th 💕',
  extraMessage: 'Get ready for a special day!',
  defaultLanguage: 'en',                      // 'en' | 'es'
};
```

## The journey

| # | Level | New mechanics | Hearts needed | Mood |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | The First Heartbeat | Basic platforms, movement | 5 | Gentle sunset |
| 2 | Through the Storms | Moving platforms + enemies | 7 | Stormy sky |
| 3 | The Grand Gesture | Disappearing platforms + all mechanics | 8 + a gold one | Night aurora |

After the third level: heart-rain cinematic → envelope reveal → typewriter love letter → full celebration.
